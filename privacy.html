	<p>We take your privacy seriously.</p>

	<p>We do not collect personal data unless you choose to provide it.</p>

	<p>
	Some of our interactive tools (e.g., Sandbox and Play apps) are hosted on third-party platforms 
	such as Streamlit Cloud or Netlify. These services may collect basic technical information 
	(e.g., IP address or usage logs) as part of their normal operation.

	If you use AI features inside our demos, only the text you type is sent securely to the AI service
